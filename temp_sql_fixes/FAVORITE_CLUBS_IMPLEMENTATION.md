## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### `agent_favorite_clubs` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_favorite_clubs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  club_id INTEGER REFERENCES clubs_transfermarkt(id),
  notes TEXT,
  added_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(agent_id, club_id)
);
```

## üß† Smart Matching Logic

### When a Player IS Recommended:

1. **Position has 0-1 players** (squad gap)
   - Example: Club has only 1 striker

2. **Players with expiring contracts** (within 12 months)
   - Example: Club's left back contract expires in 6 months

3. **Agent's player has significantly higher value** (2x or more)
   - Example: Agent's player worth ‚Ç¨200k vs club's ‚Ç¨80k player

4. **Agent's player is younger AND has similar/higher value**
   - Example: 22yo worth ‚Ç¨150k vs club's 28yo worth ‚Ç¨140k

### When a Player is NOT Recommended:

1. **Position is saturated** (2+ players with long contracts and higher/equal value)
   - Example: Club has 2 center backs, both contracted until 2026, both worth more than agent's player

## üöÄ How to Use (Testing Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# Start Supabase if not running
npx supabase start

# Apply the migration
npx supabase db reset
# OR push to remote
npx supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Database Types
```bash
# For local
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/supabase/database.types.ts

# For remote
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > lib/supabase/database.types.ts
```

### Step 3: Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test as an Agent

#### 4.1 Login/Register as Agent
1. Go to `/auth/register`
2. Select "Agent" as user type
3. Complete registration

#### 4.2 Add Players to Roster
1. Navigate to "My Roster"
2. Click "Add Player"
3. Add several players from different positions
   - Ensure you have players from Finnish Ykk√∂sliiga data
   - Try to have variety: different ages, positions, market values

#### 4.3 Add Favorite Clubs
1. Navigate to "My Clubs"
2. Click "Add Club"
3. **Filter by competition**: Select "Finland Ykk√∂sliiga" (or another competition you have data for)
4. Select a club from the filtered list
5. Optionally add notes (e.g., "Met at conference 2024")
6. Add multiple clubs to see better results

#### 4.4 View Smart Recommendations
1. Navigate to "Recommendations"
2. You should see:
   - Summary stats (favorite clubs, total matches, clubs with matches)
   - Expandable cards for each favorite club
   - Squad composition for each club
   - Players from your roster that match (with reasons)
   - Players that don't match (collapsible, with reasons)

## üìä Example Scenario

### Setup:
- **Agent has 3 players in roster:**
  - Player A: Left Back, 24yo, ‚Ç¨150k, contract expires 2025
  - Player B: Striker, 28yo, ‚Ç¨300k, contract expires 2026
  - Player C: Midfielder, 20yo, ‚Ç¨50k, contract expires 2027

- **Club X (Finland Ykk√∂sliiga) squad:**
  - Left Backs: 2 players, contracts until 2027, worth ‚Ç¨180k each
  - Strikers: 1 player, contract expires June 2025, worth ‚Ç¨200k
  - Midfielders: 1 player, 30yo, contract until 2026, worth ‚Ç¨80k

### Expected Recommendations:

**Player A (LB)**: ‚ùå NOT Recommended
- Reason: "Position saturated - 2 players already in squad"

**Player B (Striker)**: ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
- Reason: "Opportunity - 1 player(s) with expiring contracts"

**Player C (Midfielder)**: ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
- Reason: "Younger & valuable - good long-term investment"

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
- Check Supabase is running: `npx supabase status`
- Verify `is_admin()` function exists from previous migrations
- Review error logs in Supabase Studio

### No clubs appear in "Add Club" modal
- Ensure `clubs_transfermarkt` table has data
- Check that clubs have `competition_name` populated
- Look at browser console for errors

### No recommendations appear
- Ensure you've added clubs to favorites
- Ensure you have players in your roster
- Check that roster players have positions matching club squad
- Verify the club you added has players in `players_transfermarkt` table

### TypeScript errors
- Regenerate database types after migration
- Restart TypeScript server in your IDE
- Check imports are correct

## üé® UI Consistency

All components use:
- ‚úÖ Shadcn UI components (Table, Card, Badge, Button, Dialog, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS for styling
- ‚úÖ Consistent with existing agent platform design
- ‚úÖ Same color scheme as roster and opportunities pages

---

## üîí Security

- ‚úÖ RLS policies ensure agents only see their own favorite clubs
- ‚úÖ All database operations use `SECURITY DEFINER` functions
- ‚úÖ User authentication verified before any operations
- ‚úÖ Admins can view all favorite clubs for support

---

## üìù Key Design Decisions

1. **Use `competition_name` column** from `clubs_transfermarkt`
   - No need for separate leagues/competitions table
   - Simpler implementation
   - Works with current data structure

2. **Simple, explainable heuristics** for recommendations
   - No black-box AI
   - Clear reasons shown to user
   - Based on measurable criteria (squad size, contracts, values)

3. **Focus on Finnish Ykk√∂sliiga** for initial testing
   - You have complete data for this league
   - Can expand to other leagues later

4. **Transparent logic**
   - Always show WHY a recommendation is made
   - Show why players are NOT recommended
   - Agents can learn from the system

---

## üöß Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Track outreach (which players were offered to which clubs)
- Contact logging (when agent reached out, club response)
- Email notifications when new squad gaps appear
- Bulk actions (offer multiple players at once)
- Export recommendations to PDF/CSV
- Integration with club contact information
- Historical tracking of successful placements
