# Deployment Strategy (No Staging Branch - Save €35/month)

## Our Approach: Local Testing → Production

Since Supabase branching costs €35/month, we use a smart alternative that's FREE and safe.

## Workflow

### 1. Development Phase
```bash
# Work on feature locally
git checkout -b feature/player-profiles

# Test with local Supabase
npx supabase start
npm run dev

# Verify migrations work
npx supabase db reset
```

### 2. Pull Request Phase
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/player-profiles

# Create PR to main branch
# GitHub Actions automatically:
# - Runs linting
# - Tests migrations locally
# - Validates everything
```

### 3. Production Deployment
When PR is merged to main:
- Migrations automatically deploy to production
- TypeScript types are generated
- Vercel deploys the frontend

## Why This Works (No "Works on My Machine" Issues)

1. **Migrations are deterministic** - SQL files run exactly the same everywhere
2. **Supabase CLI guarantees consistency** - Same Docker images locally and in cloud
3. **GitHub Actions validates** - Tests migrations in clean environment before deploy
4. **Version control** - Everything tracked in Git

## Safety Features

- ✅ Local testing with exact production schema
- ✅ GitHub Actions validates before merge
- ✅ Pull Requests for review
- ✅ Can rollback migrations if needed
- ✅ Production deploys only from main branch

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Start local development
npx supabase start
npm run dev

# Reset local database (test migrations)
npx supabase db reset

# Check migration status
npx supabase migration list

# Create new migration
npx supabase migration new feature_name

# See what would be deployed
npx supabase db diff --linked
```

## Future Upgrade Path

When you're making €35+/month from the app, upgrade to:
1. Enable Supabase branching for true staging
2. Add more comprehensive testing
3. Add monitoring and alerts

For now, this approach is battle-tested by many startups and perfectly safe!
