## Project Overview

### Core Mission
To be an indispensable football intelligence platform that empowers clubs, agents, and players to make smarter, data-driven decisions. We're building a modern analytics and networking ecosystem that moves beyond simple data presentation to offer predictive insights and actionable recommendations.

### The Problem We Solve
The football world, particularly outside of the top-tier leagues, is inefficient and often relies on subjective scouting.
- Clubs struggle to find players that fit specific tactical and financial needs.
- Agents have limited visibility into market demands and club requirements.
- Players lack objective ways to demonstrate their true value and find clubs that are a good cultural and professional fit.

### Our Goal (The Vision)
To become the definitive "Moneyball" platform for football. We start by being the best data-driven recruitment tool ("LinkedIn on steroids") and will evolve into a predictive analytics powerhouse. Our goal is to provide clubs with a clear competitive advantage by helping them identify undervalued assets, predict player performance, and manage recruitment strategy with advanced AI.

### Key Features & Platform Pillars

#### 1. Data-Driven Analysis
- **Club Dashboard**: For deep analysis of a club's own squad strengths and weaknesses.
- **Advanced Player Scouting**: A powerful engine to discover players across leagues using nuanced data filters (performance metrics, contract status, physical attributes, etc.).
- **Player DNA Analysis (Modal)**: An in-depth player profile featuring a proprietary FootyLabs Score and a positional radar chart, benchmarking a player's percentile performance against their direct peers.

#### 2. Recruitment & Information Marketplace
- **Dynamic Marketplace**: A hub where clubs can list players for transfer/loan and post detailed recruitment needs, creating a transparent market.
- **Club Reputation & Transparency (Glassdoor for Football)**:
  - A revolutionary review system where players can anonymously rate their current and former clubs.
  - Reviews include an overall 1-5 star rating plus detailed ratings on crucial criteria like: Salary Punctuality, Fair Salary, Training Conditions, and Club Management.
  - Players can leave written comments, providing invaluable qualitative insights for others.
- **Holistic Player Profiles for Better Matchmaking**:
  - We simplify life for everyone by being a central information exchange. When players sign up, we capture the essential "human factor" data that is critical for transfers.
  - This includes information like: current salary & expectations, desired leagues/countries, family relocation needs, languages spoken, and YouTube highlight links.

#### 3. Future AI & Predictive Analytics (Roadmap)
- **Predictive Salary Estimations**: On-demand, AI-driven salary projections for any player to aid in contract negotiations and budgeting.
- **Player Similarity Engine**: An AI-powered feature to answer the question: "Find me more players like this one."
- **Performance Forecasting**: Models to predict a player's future development and potential success in a new league, reducing transfer risk.

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables for the Next.js app:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key

For Python ETL scripts (in ../webapp-backend/.env):
- `SUPABASE_DB_USER`: Database user
- `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`: Database password  
- `SUPABASE_DB_HOST`: Database host
- `SUPABASE_DB_NAME`: Database name
- `SUPABASE_DB_PORT`: Database port

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Route Structure
- `/` - Landing page
- `/auth/*` - Authentication flows (login, register, reset-password, select-club)
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with club analytics
- `/dashboard/scouting` - Player scouting with league browser and watchlist
- `/dashboard/marketplace` - Transfer marketplace with listings and recruitment needs
- `/dashboard/analytics` - Advanced analytics views
- `/dashboard/profile` - User profile management

### Authentication Flow
1. Middleware (`middleware.ts`) handles route protection and auth state
2. Uses Supabase Auth with email/password
3. After registration, users select their club affiliation
4. Session management via Supabase auth helpers

### Data Flow
1. Raw data (Excel files from Wyscout) â†’ Python ETL scripts
2. Python processes data, calculates metrics, and populates Supabase
3. Next.js app fetches data via Supabase client or API routes
4. Components use React hooks and state management for UI updates

### Key Components Architecture
- **Dashboard Components** (`/components/dashboard/*`): Performance overviews, team comparisons, player stats
- **Scouting Components** (`/components/scouting/*`): Player browser, watchlist management
- **Marketplace Components** (`/components/marketplace/*`): Listings, needs, agency prospects
- **Common Components** (`/components/common/*`): Shared modals like player detail modal
- **UI Components** (`/components/ui/*`): Shadcn UI primitives

### API Routes Pattern
All API routes follow RESTful patterns:
- GET `/api/clubs` - List clubs
- GET `/api/clubs/[id]` - Get specific club
- GET `/api/clubs/[id]/players` - Get club's players
- GET `/api/players/[id]` - Get player details
- Similar patterns for marketplace listings, recruitment needs, etc.

### Database Schema (from lib/supabase/database.types.ts)

#### Core Tables:

**players** - Main player statistics table
- `wyscout_player_id`: Unique Wyscout identifier
- `name`, `position`: Basic player info
- `club_id`: FK to clubs table
- `stats`: JSON object containing all player metrics

**clubs** - Football clubs

### Python ETL Pipeline (../webapp-backend)
The ETL pipeline processes Wyscout data:
1. **Data Loading**: Reads Excel files from Data/ directory
2. **Metrics Calculation**: Uses `wyscout_utils/wyscout_metrics.py` to calculate advanced metrics
3. **FootyLabs Score**: Proprietary scoring algorithm based on percentile rankings
4. **Database Population**: SQLAlchemy connects to Supabase PostgreSQL and populates tables

Key Python modules:
- `wyscout_utils/wyscout_ETL.py` - Core ETL functions
- `wyscout_utils/wyscout_metrics.py` - Metric calculations
- `wyscout_utils/wyscout_plots.py` - Data visualization utilities

### State Management
- No global state management library (Redux/Zustand)
- Local component state with React hooks
- Server state via Supabase real-time subscriptions where needed
- Form state managed by react-hook-form with zod validation

### Styling Conventions
- Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Shadcn UI components follow consistent theming
- Dark mode support via next-themes
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features
1. Check existing patterns in similar components
2. Use Shadcn UI components where applicable
3. Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
4. Ensure Supabase RLS policies are considered for data access
5. Add proper loading and error states
6. Add comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring:
   - Log key function entry/exit points
   - Log API requests and responses
   - Log state changes and user interactions
   - Log error conditions with context
   - Use console.log() for development, can be removed later once feature is stable
   - Example: `console.log('[FeatureName] Action performed:', { data, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() })`

### Working with Data
1. Always check if data exists in Supabase before creating new tables
2. Use database types from `/lib/supabase/database.types.ts`
3. Handle Supabase auth errors gracefully (token refresh, session expiry)
4. Consider using Supabase real-time for live updates where appropriate

### Python ETL Development
1. Place new data files in appropriate Data/ subdirectories
2. Follow existing ETL patterns in populate_*.py scripts
3. Update requirements.txt when adding new dependencies
4. Test locally before running against production database
5. Document any new metrics or calculations in code comments

## Testing
Currently no automated tests configured. Manual testing recommended for:
- Authentication flows
- Data fetching and display
- Form submissions
- Responsive design across devices

## Development Workflow & Git Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main       â†’ Production (protected, auto-deploys to Vercel + Supabase prod)
develop    â†’ Staging (auto-deploys to Supabase staging branch)  
feature/*  â†’ Feature development (local Supabase Docker)
```

### Development Process
1. **Always work on feature branches** off `develop`
2. **Test locally first** using `supabase start` (Docker containers)
3. **Create migrations** with `supabase db diff -f descriptive_name`
4. **PR to develop** for staging testing
5. **PR to main** only after staging verification

### Database Development
- **Local**: Use Supabase Docker for rapid iteration (FREE)
- **Staging**: One persistent Supabase branch for integration testing
- **Production**: Protected, only updated via approved PRs

See `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for detailed instructions.

### Commit Strategy
When making code changes, I will proactively commit work at logical breakpoints:

1. **When to Commit**:
   - After completing a feature or fixing a bug
   - After creating database migrations
   - After significant refactoring
   - After adding/updating components
   - After updating configuration files
   - When switching between different areas of work

2. **Commit Message Format**:
   - Clear, concise description of what changed
   - Focus on the "why" not just the "what"
   - Examples:
     - "feat: add player profiles table and migration"
     - "fix: resolve auth token refresh issue on session timeout"
     - "migration: add player_applications table"
     - "chore: update database types"

3. **What NOT to Commit**:
   - Partial/broken implementations
   - Debug console.log statements
   - Commented-out code blocks
   - Files with merge conflicts
   - .env files or secrets
   - Direct changes to `database.types.ts` (auto-generated)

4. **Commit Frequency**:
   - Aim for logical units of work
   - One migration per commit when possible
   - Group related changes together

## Important Notes
- The Python ETL pipeline is in a separate directory (`../webapp-backend`)
- Database types are auto-generated from Supabase schema
- All sensitive credentials must be in .env files (never commit)
- The FootyLabs Score algorithm is proprietary - maintain calculation consistency
